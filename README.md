# K8s-With-Vagrant
Create a Kubernetes environment using Vagrant

RoadMap:
1. Create Kubernetes Cluster on my 3 VMs each VM is a Node in the Cluster:
    VM1- kmaster
    VM2- kworker1
    VM3- kworker2
2. Check from kmaster that all the Node is up (state=READY)
3. Check again from VM that not in the Cluster that the Cluster is up (Using kubectl)
4.
